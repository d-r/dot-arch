# .arch

My Arch Linux configuration.

I use Arch, BTW! Back "home" after I grew weary of NixOS and everything Nix. All that complexity and confusion and tedium... And the terrible UX at every level.

## Installation

You'll need [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) and [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:d-r/dot-arch.git dot
cd dot
just
```
